[Search Algorithms Implementation ( BFS, DFS, DIJKSTR ,A*) ](https://github.com/AissamDjahnine/Suppression-of-Acoustic-Noise-in-Speech-Using-Spectral-Subtraction-)
* Searching is the universal technique of problem solving in AI. this project will give you a start with these different algorithms.
* Brute-Force Search Strategies
* * Breadth-First Search : It can be implemented using FIFO queue data structure. This method provides shortest path to the solution.
* * Depth-First Search : It is implemented in recursion with LIFO stack data structure.

* Informed (Heuristic) Search Strategies
* * A Star Search : It is best-known form of Best First search.In this project I've implemented A* algorithm with :
* * *The Manhattan Distance Heuristic : this method of computing is called the Manhattan method because it is computed by calculating the total number of squares moved horizontally and vertically to reach the target square from the current square. We ignore diagonal movement and any obstacles that might be in the way.
* * *The Euclidean Distance Heuristic : his heuristic is slightly more accurate than its Manhattan counterpart. If we try run both simultaneously on the same maze, the Euclidean path finder favors a path along a straight line. This is more accurate but it is also slower because it has to explore a larger area to find the path.

[Suppression of Acoustic Noise in Speech Using Spectral Subtraction](https://github.com/AissamDjahnine/Suppression-of-Acoustic-Noise-in-Speech-Using-Spectral-Subtraction-)
* *Based on the work of STEVE F.BOLI , Paper available at : [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1163209)*

[Markov Decision Process](https://github.com/AissamDjahnine/markov-decision-process)
* *A Markov decision process (MDP) is a discrete time stochastic control process. It provides a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. MDPs are useful for studying optimization problems solved via dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. MDPs were known at least as early as the 1950s;a core body of research on Markov decision processes resulted from Ronald Howard's 1960 book, Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes.They are used in many disciplines, including robotics, automatic control, economics and manufacturing. The name of MDPs comes from the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov.*
